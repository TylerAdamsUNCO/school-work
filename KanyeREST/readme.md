A RESTful API written in C# and using Windows Presentation Foundation. This application allows a user to enter a title of any Kanye West
song and then retrieves the lyrics of it, displaying them on the screen. It is unfortunately currently defunct due to the API it was
consuming, http://www.kanyerest.xyz/docs, no longer being active.
